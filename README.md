# Hi, I'm Sam 👋🏼👨🏻‍💻
I'm a budding Software Engineer with experience in full-stack and cloud development. I also study Computer Science at the University of Toronto.


## Work Experience :computer:
I am interning at [407 ETR](https://www.407etr.com/en/index.html) 🛣️ as a Cloud Engineer. 

Prior to that, I volunteered to develop software at [Packt](packt.ca) ☕.

The world is welcome to contact me at `samhuifromhk@gmail.com`.


## Skill development roadmap 🌱
These are just a handful topics that I aim to (re)learn and build projects with in 2023:

```javascript
const toLearn = {
	"fields": ["theory and implementation of distributed systems", "system design", "parallel programming"],
	"tech": ["dom api", "next.js", "cassandra" "mongodb", "rust", "docker", "aws"]
}
```
